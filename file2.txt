Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/vivek/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:

+-----------------+

The above command creates ~/.ssh/ directory. So if your user name is vivek, than all files are stored in /home/vivek/.ssh/ or $HOME/.ssh/ directory as follows:

    $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa – Your private key
    $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub – Your public key

Please note that the passphrase must be different from your current password and do not share keys or passphrase with anyone. Also, make sure you have correct and secure permissions on $HOME/.ssh/ directory:

chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/

Keys Are Generated, What Next?

You need to copy $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to remote server so that you can login using keys instead of the password. Use any one of the following command to copy key to remote server called vpn22.nixcraft.net.in for vivek user:
ssh-copy-id vivek@vpn22.nixcraft.net.in

On some *nix system such as OS X ssh-copy-id command may not be installed, use the following commands (when prompted provide the password for remote user account called vivek) to install/append the public key on remote host:
ssh vivek@vpn22.nixcraft.net.in "umask 077; mkdir .ssh"
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh vivek@vpn22.nixcraft.net.in "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

To login simply type:
ssh vivek@vpn22.nixcraft.net.in

The following command will help to remember passphrase
exec ssh-agent $SHELL
ssh-add
ssh vivek@vpn22.nixcraft.net.in
